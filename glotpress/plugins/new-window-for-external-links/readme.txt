New Window for External Links is a plugin for GlotPress that will open any "a" link on the GlotPress site in a new _blank window instead of the current one.

This is useful so that the "Proudly powered by GlotPress" link at the bottom of each page open's in it's own window instead of overwriting the current one.

To enable this plugin, add the following lines to your gp-config.php file:

	define( 'GP_NEW_WINDOW_FOR_EXTERNAL_LINKS', true );
