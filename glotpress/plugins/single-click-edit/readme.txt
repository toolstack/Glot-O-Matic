Single Click Edit is a plugin for GlotPress that will enable users to single click anywhere on the translation row to open the editor instead of having to click on "Details" or double click the row.

To enable this plugin, add the following lines to your gp-config.php file:

	define( 'GP_SINGLE_CLICK_EDIT', true );
